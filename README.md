## Concept

HelpTheMidlands is a web application designed to allow people to volunteer in their local communities by picking up shopping for those currently isolating due to coronavirus, or those who are older and may find it difficult to go to the shops.

This app has been designed with simplicity in mind, as we find that many online stores make it confusing for the elderly to place an order then setup a delivery slot.

Volunteers respond to requests made by supportees (*vulnerable people*) for food or other shopping.

## Usage

You can register as a **volunteer** or a **supportee** using your name, an email address and a password. 

Once logged in, the supportee makes a request (shopping list) for each item of shopping they need, with a note of their budget and their preferred store. (Could be the local corner shop as opposed to be a chain).

A request is then sent out to nearby volunteers, who can then accept it and buy the shopping, delivering it to the vulnerable person.
